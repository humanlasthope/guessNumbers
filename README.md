# Guess Numbers
### Abstract
This is a simple guessing game. At the start, a random number is automatically generated on the web page without the user being able to see the random number. The user has to enter a number in a range from 1 to 20 to see if they can guess the correct random number.
### Tasks
1. Flex layout
2. Listening events for form controls
3. Triggering events to change elements of the DOM tree
